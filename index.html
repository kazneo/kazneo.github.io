            Hello! My name is Kazuki, and I recently graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a Bachelor's degree in 
            Information Technology and Web Science with a focus in Machine and Computational Learning. Currently, I am pursuing a 
            Master's degree at RPI, studying Information Technology with a focus in Managing Infomation System. With a solid foundation 
            in web development and machine learning, my undergraduate studies centered on Machine Learning, where I developed a passion 
            for leveraging technology to solve complex problems.
            </br></br>
            As I advance my education, I am eager to integrate my technical expertise with strategic management skills to lead innovative 
            projects and teams. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always keen to learn and apply new technologies. I am constantly 
            seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. Feel free to connect with me and talk with me!!
