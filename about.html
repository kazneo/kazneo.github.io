      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        I'm a technology strategist and problem-solver who turns complex ideas into impactful solutions. As a recent graduate with a Master's in Information Technology
        and a Bachelor's in IT & Web Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, my academic work focused on bridging the gap between cutting-edge technologies, such
        as AI/ML and quantum computing, and real-world needs while considering technical feasibility.
        <br><br>
        What truly drives me is working at the intersection of technology and strategy. I've built AI-driven applications to enhance decision-making,
        implemented full-stack platforms to improve usability, and explored quantum algorithms that push the boundaries of what's possible. 
        My work has taken me from fast-paced startups to collaborations with NASA and Johnson & Johnson, where precision and measurable outcomes are paramount.
        <br><br>
        My toolkit includes Python, R, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks, along with a strong ability in translating technical insights into clear,
        actionable strategies. I thrive in environments where I can analyze complex systems, identify growth opportunities, and bridge the gap between technical
        teams and business stakeholders.
        <br><br>
        For me, technology isn't just about code; it's a powerful tool for enabling people and transforming processes. I'm endlessly curious about how emerging 
        trends in AI, quantum computing, and infrastructure can reshape industries and solve problems we haven't even defined yet.
